# Sniper Log

## About
Sniper Log is an Android app that allows you to keep track of guns, ranges, rifle scopes and ammunition, as well as record target shots with corrections, pictures and notes. The data is analyzed with a ballistic calculator and sight correction algorithms that take into account atmospheric conditions and the shooter's experience.

The app automatically records environmental conditions such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction when connected to the internet but is also capable of operating completely offline. 
AI hit detection enables automatic detection and evaluation of holes in the target, making it easier to analyze shooting accuracy.
